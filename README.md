This Solidity contract represents a basic implementation of an ERC-20 token with functionalities for transferring tokens, approving spending, minting new tokens, and burning existing tokens. Here is a summary of the key components:

1. **License Information:**
   - The contract specifies the MIT license in the comments at the beginning.

2. **Contract Declaration:**
   - The contract inherits from the `IERC20` interface.

3. **State Variables:**
   - `totalSupply`: The total supply of the token.
   - `balanceOf`: A mapping of token balances for each address.
   - `allowance`: A mapping of allowances given by token owners to spenders.
   - `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`: Strings representing the name, symbol, and decimals of the token.

4. **External Functions:**
   - `transfer()`: Allows users to transfer tokens to another address.
   - `approve()`: Allows users to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf.
   - `transferFrom()`: Allows a spender to transfer tokens from the owner's account to another account.

5. **Minting and Burning:**
   - `mint()`: Allows the contract owner to mint new tokens.
   - `burn()`: Allows a token holder to burn (destroy) their own tokens.

6. **Events:**
   - The contract emits `Transfer` and `Approval` events as required by the ERC-20 standard.

7. **Supply Mechanism:**
   - The contract provides basic functionality for minting and burning tokens.

8. **Naming and Symbol:**
   - Strings representing the name ("Solidity by Example") and symbol ("SOLBYEX") of the token.

This contract serves as a straightforward example for educational purposes and does not include some advanced features found in more comprehensive ERC-20 implementations. Users can deploy and interact with this contract on the Ethereum blockchain to understand the fundamental aspects of ERC-20 token functionality.
